# README

This is the code part of DS 577 final project at Rutgers University, a elective course toward Master of Data Science program.

## Structure

* Please refer to `report.pdf` for detail analysis.

* `.ipynb` files are Jupyter notebook files. `project-hadoop-result.ipynb` is
loading the Hadoop results stored in `out/` folder. `project-spark.ipynb` files
are PySpark code, which, if you need to reproduce the result, needs additional
configurations and the original dataset (around 2.5 GB).

* `src` folder contains the mapper and reducer Python script.

* `out` folder contains the output of Hadoop system.

If you have any question reagarding the original datset or anything else, feel
free to contact [@taiyang](https://github.com/taiyang)
Thank you!
